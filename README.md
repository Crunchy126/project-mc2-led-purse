# Use an ESP32 to display GIFs on your Project Mc2 LED purse

I recommend using the [PCB I designed](https://github.com/rorosaurus/esp32-hub75-driver) to simplify your wiring. But there's no reason why you wouldn't wire this up manually yourself if you want! :)

This project is forked from Marc Merlin's fantastic [AnimatedGIFs](https://github.com/marcmerlin/AnimatedGIFs) repository. Please check out that page for information about how to use this project in greater detail.
